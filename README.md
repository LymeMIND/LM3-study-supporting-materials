## Outline

This repository contains all the source code and de-identified data for the project.

### [LM3_all_figures.ipynb](./LM3_all_figures.ipynb)

This is a jupyter notebook which was used to generate all of the LM3 figures. It was run with the **original data** which is not publicly available, please contact us if you'd like to access to that data. Alternatively de-identified version of that same data has been provided and can be used instead to an extent.

### [Data](./data)

This is de-identified data which can be used to re-produce our analysis or find additional things about our cohort as a whole without per-patient specificity.
